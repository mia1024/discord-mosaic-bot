# Status of this repository
This repository contains the source code of the Discord bot Mosaic (`mosaic#1013`, bot user ID `771643297088667648`).

This project is currently a work in progress. As such, there is no public way for anyone to try the bot out. 
If you would like to join the alpha test server, please contact me. The beta phase will begin soon. 

The source code is provided for educational purpose only. In each release, instructions will be provided on how to run
the bot locally. While the instructions aim to be functional, no support will be provided in setting up your own
instance of the bot. However, you may not deploy any Discord bot that utilizes any portion of this project's
source code to more than 3 servers. 

# Mosaic Bot

The only Discord emoji bot you'll ever need. Let's be mosaic! It sends out emojis on you behalf...well, a slightly
larger version, perhaps.
